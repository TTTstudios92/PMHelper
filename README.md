Intended for Instrument Techs to calculate error percentage

The Calculator App is a web-based tool that allows you to calculate the error percentage between actual mA readings and ideal mA values based on specified test points and input values. It also provides a graphical representation of the data.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter the Lower Range Value (LRV) and Upper Range Value (URV) in the respective input fields.
3. Enter the actual mA readings and input values for each test point in the table.
4. Click the "Calculate" button to perform the calculations and generate the results.
5. The calculated Span, Test Points, and Error Percentages will be displayed below the table.
6. The graph will show the actual and ideal mA values plotted against the input values.

## Dependencies

- [Plotly.js](https://plotly.com/javascript/) - Plotly.js library for creating interactive charts.
